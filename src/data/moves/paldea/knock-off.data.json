If the user has not fainted, the target loses its held item. This move cannot cause Pokemon with the Sticky Hold Ability to lose their held item or cause a Kyogre, a Groudon, a Giratina, an Arceus, a Genesect, a Silvally, a Zacian, or a Zamazenta to lose their Blue Orb, Red Orb, Griseous Orb, Plate, Drive, Memory, Rusted Sword, or Rusted Shield respectively. Items lost to this move cannot be regained with Recycle or the Harvest Ability.",
