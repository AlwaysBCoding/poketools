At the end of each turn including the turn used, the perish count of all active Pokemon lowers by 1 and Pokemon faint if the number reaches 0. The perish count is removed from Pokemon that switch out. If a Pokemon uses Baton Pass while it has a perish count, the replacement will gain the perish count and continue to count down.",
