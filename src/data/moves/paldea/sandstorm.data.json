At the end of each turn except the last, all active Pokemon lose 1/16 of their maximum HP, rounded down, unless they are a Ground, Rock, or Steel type, or have the Magic Guard, Overcoat, Sand Force, Sand Rush, or Sand Veil Abilities. During the effect, the Special Defense of Rock-type Pokemon is multiplied by 1.5 when taking damage from a special attack. Lasts for 8 turns if the user is holding Smooth Rock. Fails if the current weather is Sandstorm.",
