Fails if either the user or the target is holding a Mail or Z-Crystal, if neither is holding an item, if the user is trying to give or take a Mega Stone to or from the species that can Mega Evolve with it, or if the user is trying to give or take a Blue Orb, a Red Orb, a Griseous Orb, a Plate, a Drive, or a Memory to or from a Kyogre, a Groudon, a Giratina, an Arceus, a Genesect, or a Silvally, respectively. The target is immune to this move if it has the Sticky Hold Ability."
