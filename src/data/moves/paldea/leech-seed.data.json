  "description": "The Pokemon at the user's position steals 1/8 of the target's maximum HP, rounded down, at the end of each turn. If Big Root is held by the recipient, the HP recovered is 1.3x normal, rounded half down. If the target uses Baton Pass, the replacement will continue being leeched. If the target switches out or uses Mortal Spin or Rapid Spin successfully, the effect ends. Grass-type Pokemon are immune to this move on use, but not its effect.",
