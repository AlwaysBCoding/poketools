  "description": "For 5 turns, the terrain becomes Grassy Terrain. During the effect, the power of Grass-type attacks used by grounded Pokemon is multiplied by 1.3, the power of Bulldoze, Earthquake, and Magnitude used against grounded Pokemon is multiplied by 0.5, and grounded Pokemon have 1/16 of their maximum HP, rounded down, restored at the end of each turn, including the last turn. Camouflage transforms the user into a Grass type, Nature Power becomes Energy Ball, and Secret Power has a 30% chance to cause sleep. Fails if the current terrain is Grassy Terrain."
