If there is no target or the target avoids this move by protecting itself, the user's held item is still lost. The user can regain a thrown item with Recycle or the Harvest Ability. Fails if the user has no held item, if the held item cannot be thrown, if the user is under the effect of Embargo or Magic Room, or if the user has the Klutz Ability.",
